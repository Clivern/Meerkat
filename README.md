`Scuti` automates the patching process for a group of virtual servers, handling updates ranging from basic operating system upgrades to customized scripts. The system offers various strategies for updating servers, including sequential updates, batch updates, or percentage-based updates to ensure optimal availability.

`Scuti` named after `UY Scuti`, The red supergiant star in the constellation Scutum. It is considered to be possibly one of the largest known stars and is also a pulsating variable star, with a volume nearly 5 billion times that of the sun.
